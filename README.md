# patterns

An infinite, immersive visual experience.

Features 5 tracks and 4 patterns.

## Music

Music comes from [Icons8](https://icons8.com).

However, this music is not freely available.

As such, it has not been uploaded in Git, and is only available on the official patterns site.

If you choose to use different music, update that in `src/tracks.ts`.

**The build will fail if you do not add your own music.**
